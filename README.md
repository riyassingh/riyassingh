## Hi there 👋

# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Riya Singh**, a passionate and detail-oriented **Full Stack Developer** with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I specialize in building robust, user-centric applications that combine modern design with powerful functionality. From crafting seamless user experiences with React and Tailwind CSS to developing secure and scalable backends with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and MySQL — I thrive at every layer of the stack. My recent work includes building an AI Image Generator using generative AI models and a Hospital Management System designed to streamline real-world healthcare operations. I’m constantly exploring emerging technologies like AI, cloud platforms, and modern frameworks to build solutions that are not just functional, but innovative. I'm driven by curiosity, clean code, and the desire to make a real impact through technology.
